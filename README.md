# Description
Nimrodel is a staking dapp for Scarcity that rewards users in Dai payments. 

# Structure
Nimrodel is made up of Rivulet contracts. Each Rivulet has a Dai balance, a global flow rate (Dai per second) and a maximum allowable scarcity to stake. 
Users experience a flow of dai in the proportion of their personal stake to the maximum stake. As total Scarcity staked rises, the global flow rate increases.
Users payments are calculated on a per second basis.

# Sponsorship 
Nimrodel offers a way for Sponsors to advertise to very Defi oriented eyes. There will be a number of tiers that sponsors can use to target defi crowd.

# Purspose
Scarcity is the liquidity token for Behodler. The more Scarcity purchased, the higher the liquidity. Until enough liquidity is deposited, Behodler will struggle to be profitable for arbitraging whales. Nimrodel exists to incentivize Defi oriented sponsors to entice Defi users to fill Behodler's liquidity reserves.
